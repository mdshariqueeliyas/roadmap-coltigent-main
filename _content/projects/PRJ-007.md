# Executive Summary
Unexpected stoppages during paint-line changeovers are causing significant delays. By implementing a proactive risk management system for component failures, we can minimize downtime and improve overall throughput, which is essential for meeting production targets.

## Deliverables
- [ ] Develop a predictive maintenance system for components
- [ ] Train technicians on risk assessment protocols
- [ ] Implement real-time monitoring tools
- [ ] Establish a reporting framework for failure risks
