# Executive Summary
The current manual processes for warranty claim handoffs between dealers and central support lead to customer frustration and inefficiencies. By modernizing the claims workflow, we can enhance transparency, reduce rework, and improve customer satisfaction, which is critical for maintaining trust and loyalty.

## Deliverables
- [ ] Develop a digital claims management system
- [ ] Implement consistent triage rules for escalations
- [ ] Train staff on new workflow processes
- [ ] Establish clear ownership protocols for claims
