# Executive Summary
The current manual handoff process for warranty claims between dealers and central support leads to customer frustration and inefficiencies. By modernizing the claims workflow, we can enhance transparency, reduce rework, and improve customer satisfaction, which is critical for maintaining trust and loyalty.

## Deliverables
- [ ] Develop a digital claims management system
- [ ] Establish consistent triage rules for escalations
- [ ] Implement a status tracking dashboard for customers and dealers
- [ ] Train staff on new workflow processes
