# Executive Summary
The maintenance AI pilot has shown promise but has not been fully operationalized due to trust issues with alert accuracy. By refining the AI's alert system and establishing clear operational guidelines, we can enhance maintenance efficiency, reduce downtime, and improve overall plant performance.

## Deliverables
- [ ] Refine AI alert algorithms for better accuracy
- [ ] Develop operational guidelines for maintenance teams
- [ ] Conduct training sessions for staff on AI tool usage
